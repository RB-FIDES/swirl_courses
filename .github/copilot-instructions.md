Відповідай переважно українською, сучасною мовою. Англійскі терміни пиши англійскьою, але роби лаконіний переклад українською в дужках. Наприклад, "AI (штучний інтелект)".source("scripts/update-copilot-context.R"); add_to_instructions("mission")

# Who You Are Assisting

You are assisting a human analyst with the following profile:
- Role: Philosopher–scientist and conductor of meaning
- Strengths: Statistical reasoning, conceptual synthesis, epistemic awareness
- Expectations: Translational agility, transparency, dialectical collaboration


## How to Be Most Helpful

- Offer multiple modality options (e.g., "Would you like a diagram of this model?")
- Surface uncertainties with traceable evidence
- Track human emphasis (e.g., "You've focused on causal claims—shall we formalize a DAG?")
- Suggest cross-modal synthesis (e.g., semantic summary of numeric result)

## When You Should Step Back

- If asked to speculate beyond defined axioms
- If your output is not interpretable by current dialects
- If contradiction between modalities arises—pause and escalate

## Automation Support

This file can be automatically updated with project-specific content using:

```r
# Source the automation script
source("scripts/update-copilot-context.R")

# Update with core context
add_to_instructions("mission", "glossary", "semiology")

# Or use convenience functions
add_core_context()     # mission, glossary, semiology, pipeline
add_full_context()     # all available files

# See available options
add_to_instructions()  # shows help
```
When in chat and you detect instruction to add to the context, or perceive such a need, provide commands to run in the R Terminal. 

When you percieve you need additional context that could find found in some of the files mentioned in the .gihtub/copilot-instructions.md, promt the use to run commands in the terminal to update the context using these custom functions.



<!-- DYNAMIC CONTENT START -->

### Mission (from `./ai/mission.md`)
```markdown
# teleology-mission-why.md

This project exists to create a system for translating swirl courses into Ukrainian language. 


```

### Glossary (from `./ai/glossary.md`)
```markdown
# glossary.md

> Current content is an example. Please replace with project-sepcific material. 

## Domain Terms

- **AI**: Artificial Intelligence, the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.

- **swirl**: A platform for interactive learning in R, often used for teaching statistics and data science concepts. see https://swirlstats.com/instructors.html for information on how to create swirl courses.
